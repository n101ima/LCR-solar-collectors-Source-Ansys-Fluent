# LCR-solar-collectors-Source-Ansys-Fluent
This UDF defines a function that adds a heat flux source term to the energy equation at a given cell and thread in Fluent. The UDF is related to the LCR (low concentration ratio) solar collectors, which are solar thermal devices that use reflectors to concentrate the solar radiation onto a receiver. The UDF uses the following parameters and variables:

•  heat_flux_source: the name of the user-defined function that takes four arguments: c, t, dS, and eqn.

•  c: a variable that represents a cell in the cell loop.

•  t: a pointer to the thread structure of the cell zone where the heat flux source term is added.

•  dS: an array that stores the linearization coefficients for the source term.

•  eqn: an index that represents the equation ID of the energy equation.

•  angle: a scalar that represents the angle between the x-axis and the line connecting the origin and the cell centroid. It has units of degrees.

•  x[ND_ND]: an array that stores the coordinates of the cell centroid.

•  heat_flux: a scalar that represents the heat flux at the cell c. It has units of W/m^2.

•  source: a scalar that represents the heat flux source term at the cell c. It has units of W/m^3.

•  C_CENTROID: a macro that returns the coordinates of the cell centroid and stores them in x.

•  C_VOLUME: a macro that returns the volume of the cell c and thread t.

The UDF performs the following steps:


It defines some constants and variables for the simulation.
It calculates the coordinates of the cell centroid using C_CENTROID and stores them in x.
It calculates
the angle between
the x-axis and
the line connecting
the origin and
the cell centroid using atan2 and stores it in angle.
It calculates
the heat flux at
the cell c using a piecewise polynomial expression based on angle and stores it in heat_flux. The expression is given by $$heat_flux = \begin{cases} -2.588e-7 \angle^5 + 4.175e-5 \angle^4 - 2.258e-3 \angle^3 + 0.04643 \angle^2 - 0.01496 \angle + 26.65 & \text{if } 0 \leq \angle < 68 \ 4.071e-4 \angle^3 - 0.1121 \angle^2 + 9.099 \angle - 181.1 & \text{if } 68 \leq \angle < 114 \ -2.175e-6 \angle^3 + 1.135e-3 \angle^2 - 0.1821 \angle + 9.668 & \text{if } 114 \leq \angle < 180 \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ where $\angle$ is
the angle
in degrees.
It calculates
the heat flux source term at
the cell c by dividing heat_flux by C_VOLUME and stores it in source.
It sets
the linearization coefficient for
the source term to zero by assigning dS[eqn] to zero.
It returns source as
the output
of
the function.

The UDF can be used to model heat transfer problems with LCR solar collectors, such as solar water heating, solar desalination, or solar cooling systems.
